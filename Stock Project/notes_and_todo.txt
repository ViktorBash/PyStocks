To Do:
Make a good matplotlib chart with the data
integrate that matplotlib chart into the GUI

use NYSE or Nasdaq (preferably both) and make a system so that when a company name is typed in instead of a ticker
symbol, it still will pull up the info. To Do this:
compile list of stock ticker symbols and list of names (from same csv file)
put them together in a dictionary
create a simple function in yfinance that returns the ticker symbol when given the stockname (this will either
hold the dictionary, or unpickle it or just make the dictionary)
add an if statement to each thing like stock_up_or_down saying if it's not a ticker symbol, go to the above function
and get the ticker symbol

write a unit test for the yfinance_part.py script


Far off:
Raising exceptions when a stock name that doesn't exist is typed in
